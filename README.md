This helps to maintain and setup Linux systems. There is an Arch and Ubuntu based version, both versions help with managing services, setting up basic configuration that tries to be as secure an performance driven as possible. These scripts have a way to go, but for now, they should work for you. They also help with cleaning and maintenance. Some basic troubleshooting can be done with the systeminfo tool. Hostsfile selector will download the hostsman4linux script from another repository I am working in concert with.
