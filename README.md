To use Linux-Toolbox, you must first ensure that the scripts are
executable, to do this, you have to type chmod +x Arch-Utilities.sh in a 
command line, I know, it can be scary at first, but trust me, aside from 
actually calling this script, that's all you will have to do. To call this
script you have to type the name in the terminal like this:
./Arch-Utilities.sh. That should do it. This script easily handles all 
the hard work for you. Each function has a number in the list associated 
with it, just type the number of the chore you need done and this handy 
utility goes right to work. Some root privilege may be required
(You may have to put in your password). These scripts are named based on 
the Operating system(distribution) they are meant to work on.

I wrote these scripts and of course, I had to learn to 
do some of the things in this work. Much of the ideas and information came
from various other linux users. Without their massive contributions to the 
community, this project of mine would not be possible. A list of acknowledge-
